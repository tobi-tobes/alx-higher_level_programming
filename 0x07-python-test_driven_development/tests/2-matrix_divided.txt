 How to Use 2-matrix_divided.py
===============================

This module has only has one function called
``matrix_divided()``.

Output
=======

``matrix_divided()`` divides the elements of a list of lists
by div, to two decimal places. The first argument must be
a matrix (a list of lists) and the second argument must
be a number (integer or float). The return is a matrix of the
quotients of division.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3)
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

It also works with negative or positive floating-point values

::

    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3.0)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3.0)
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Errors
======

If 'matrix' is not a list of lists of floats/integers, or
'div' is not a float or integer, ``matrix_divided()``
will raise a TypeError. If 'div' is 0, ``matrix_divided()``
will raise a ZeroDivisionError. Also, if the lists
within the matrix are not the same length,
``matrix_divided()`` will raise a TypeError.
